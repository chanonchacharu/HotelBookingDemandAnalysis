For this notebook, I will be using [PySpark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/#:~:text=PySpark%20is%20the%20Python%20API,for%20interactively%20analyzing%20your%20data.) to perform queries. \n","\n","Last semester, I took a Big Data Analysis course, which is where I was introduced to Apache Spark. <br>\n","At this moment,  I am in the process of revising this concept; hence, I choose PySpark for this notebook. \n","\n","If you have any suggestion, please let me know!\n","\n","### Installation\n","In order to use PySpark on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), it must be installed by typing the following command `!pip install pyspark` into one of the cell.
